// Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the
information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n). 

Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:

Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search key.
Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.

// C++ program to implement recursive Binary Search
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A recursive binary search function. It returns
// location of x in given array arr[l..r] is present,
// otherwise -1
int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x)
{
	if (r >= l) {
		int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

		// If the element is present at the middle
		// itself
		if (arr[mid] == x)
			return mid;

		// If element is smaller than mid, then
		// it can only be present in left subarray
		if (arr[mid] > x)
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x);

		// Else the element can only be present
		// in right subarray
		return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x);
	}

	// We reach here when element is not
	// present in array
	return -1;
}

int main(void)
{
	int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
	int x = 10;
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x);
	(result == -1)
		? cout << "Element is not present in array"
		: cout << "Element is present at index " << result;
	return 0;
